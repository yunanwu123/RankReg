Description: Estimate the coefficients in high-dimensional linear regressions via a tuning-free and robust approach, Rank Lasso, and second-stage enhancements, Rank SCAD and Rank MCP. To overcome the computational barrier arising from the U-statistics structure in Rank regressions, QICD algorithms and the incomplete U-statistics resampling technique are applied in the package.
